        <p>
            <b>Safe Learning-Based Control on quadrotors (Course Project)</b></h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>This research project explores a method to improve the future performance of a dynamic system using past system data.</li>
                <li>Model predictive control strategy is used for optimization and path prediction for the quadrotors.</li>
                <li>Gaussian Process Model Predictive Control (GPMPC) was applied as a learning-based control method for overcoming error in the quadrotor's dynamics.</li>
                <li>The decision-making of the MPC and the GP's learning and estimation will be studied and utilized to improve tracking performance, this was then tested in simulation on multiple trajectories.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Communicating Robot Intentions for Human</b>
            <ul>
                <li>A team project which attempted to understand how comfortable most people are with human robot collaboration.</li>
                <li>Simulated a Franka Emika Robot using ROS2.</li>
                <li>A simulation for the robotic arm was developed using ROS2 visualizer.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Senior Design Capstone</b>
            <ul>
                <li>I Designed a prototype for automatically monitoring and controlling a shrimp tank environment.</li>
                <li>Multiple Subsystems were developed to automate the tank environment.</li>
                <li>Implemented each major functionality using Arduinos and a Raspberry Pi Module 4 on Arduino and Linux systems.</li>
                <li>Developed an implementation plan, maintenance manual, and user manual for each embedded sub-system</li>
            </ul>
